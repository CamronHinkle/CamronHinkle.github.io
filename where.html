          This major turning ushered in new methods of enforcing power, leaving behind the panoptic institutions that
          controlled large populations of the past in favor of a new synoptic model where the many watch the
          few(Nealson, 2012 p. 130). The data from the behavioral surplus enables the automation of population-wide
          monitoring by just a handful of programs. In these systems, the threat of rebellion is reduced as the watchers
          willingly impose the rules on themselves and those around them. This is once again extended further by
          controlling the preferences of individuals through controlling what builds their (endogenous)preferences, the
          media, and advertising. For example, we can look at the 1998 movie “The Truman Show” where the main character
          unknowingly lives his entire life from birth on camera for the entertainment of others. This highlights the
          pervasive influence media has as surveillance not only being able to shape the behavior of the one in front of
          the camera but also the rest of the population viewing this pseudo-reality show.

          This immense power is wielded almost exclusively by unregulated international media conglomerates that have
          slowly implemented vertical integration to corner the market on our perception. Through their control of the
          media, they are able to reproduce a skewed and censored worldview with limited interpretations and inaccurate
          representations. This perpetuates harmful biases as viewers internalize the portals they see as “A key problem
          with racism is that it can be a self-fulfilling phenomenon if people believe that Joseph will be a less
          productive worker because of his race there will be a discrimination in hiring him facing lower demand for his
          services. It is then rational for Joseph to underinvest in his own education because the expected returns will
          be lower. “(Wright, 141-142). This underscores how we situate ourselves within the context of our environment
          and if that context continuously tells us what we are like or should be like then we will believe it and
          replicate it.

          In particular, Disney stands out as a cornerstone of our global culture due to the fact that "Disney stories
          the stories Disney tells will be the stories that will form and help form a child's imaginary world all over
          the world and that's an incredible amount of power"(Mickey Mouse Monopoly, 2002). Given that we established
          the sheer amount of time individuals spend consuming media it is important to consider the messages these
          stories/images tell us about the world. We can see an example of this through how Disney standardized play
          with their toys. By bombarding individuals with media surrounding a film/story and using each of these as an
          advertisement it reinforces the messages conveyed. The impact of this can be seen by the fixed nature of play
          not evolving or changing beyond the plot explored on screen. Play is a form of development and a way to
          explore the world around them through this they develop skills.

          However, their influence does not end with play to standardize how we consume media, form relationships, and
          work through their brand image. We replicate the lives and relationships we consume even including the
          corporate brand personalities. Sociologist Erving Goffman described how we view these idealized fictitious
          worlds as “commercial realism" and these near-perfect worlds could come to fruition through our actions and
          purchases(746). For instance, many adults consume dating shows, reality TV, or other dramatized narratives
          where on-screen relationships are depicted as a necessity, not an option. This is reflected in modern dating
          culture through the stigmatization of being single. Individuals would rather settle for the most reasonable of
          limited imperfect options rather than embracing solitude or waiting for a genuine connection to naturally
          form.

          Societal pressures drive us to conform yet paradoxically we all strive to stand out and thus converge to form
          the aesthetic of individuality. As Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno eloquently state in Dialectic of
          Enlightenment “Capitalism promises a system of raw individuality and transcendence of self-being able to act
          as a free agent in your pursuit of happiness”. However, in practice, this promise is not achieved not only do
          we share the desire to construct a distinct image of ourselves but we are united in our forced uniformity. By
          largely consuming the same products due to limited viable options, many similar preferences emerge in the
          population. Then there is the “or else” mindset of fear and conformity that keeps individuals to norms and
          expectations. This can be seen when choosing products, defining yourself, or making career decisions leaving
          many working the same comfortable jobs and spending all they earn on simple needs. Deviation is met with
          repercussions that limit autonomy for example, you better like what they like or else no one will like you.
          You better fit into their description or else you won't get hired. You better behave how they want or else
          you'll get fired. You better work when they want you to or else you won't make rent.

        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          You are promised freedom but have restrictions and challenges imposed to minimize the number of those who
          deviate. In our late-capitalistic system, this false autonomy can be seen in modern advances like streaming
          services. They grant you the freedom of choice at the cost of increased individual fees. You pay the price to
          watch what you want when you want it but end up needing to subscribe to numerous services costing you more. In
          a way, they are to media as cars are to transportation. Both make you pay many individual fees to increase
          your autonomy across a preset network of options.
