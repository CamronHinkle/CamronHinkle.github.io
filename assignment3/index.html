				becomes a bustling thoroughfare filled with enchanting shops and magical landmarks for all of the
				spirits.
				<br>
				Follow the Spirited Aroma: Yubaba's Bathhouse is known for its distinctive aroma, a blend of magical
				herbs and soothing fragrances. Follow this captivating scent as it wafts through Miyazaki Street,
				guiding you to your destination.
				<br>
				Look for the soribashi or moon bridge: Yubaba's Bathhouse is adorned with unique and mystical symbols.
				Keep an eye out for these symbols on the buildings along Miyazaki Street. They serve as beacons, leading
				you closer to the magical haven.

				<h2>Manager</h2>
				<p>
				Yubaba is the formidable proprietor of the bathhouse in Spirited Away. Known for her commanding presence
				and powerful magic, she oversees the establishment with strict rules. Despite her stern exterior, Yubaba
				possesses complex layers, balancing her business acumen with a softer side, particularly towards her
				baby son, Boh. While Yubaba is the primary owner, her twin sister, Zeniba, also plays a role in the
				bathhouse's dynamics, showcasing a more benevolent and understanding nature. The proprietors, with their
				unique personalities, contribute to the bathhouse's intricate and magical world.
