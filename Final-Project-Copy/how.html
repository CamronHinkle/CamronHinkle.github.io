        <p class="about-text px-5">
          With no end to capitalism it can be said that we are experiencing a <strong>“slow cancelation of the future”</strong>(Bennett,
          2022) our future is simply a reinterpretation of the past which changes how we experience time itself. We
          segment history into distinct epochs by the forms of art and artistic expression associated with them.
          Selected elements of a period that are still being studied and expressed form a dynamic visual identity or as
          Gen Z would call it an aesthetic(53-55). Youth cultures of today merely merge these aesthetics to create new
          combinations that more closely match their visual image without yielding anything profoundly new. <strong>This image
          begins to form the base of our personal brand as an outward projection of the self.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Out of this practice, <strong>Lifestyle Branding emerged</strong>, and the market reflected this practice in a realization that
          “to be truly successful …[companies]had to understand that <strong>their true product was not their product</strong>… it was an
          idea, a lifestyle, meaning itself” (Klein, 2003). Over time the connection grows stronger as the youth's style
          and identity become a reflection of the brand's ideologies further solidifying their cultural relevance. We
          can see this even in the invention of the smartphone where IBM made the first touchscreen phone in 1992 it had
          a calculator, email, and could even access the web but only 50,000 people bought one(IBM). This was an
          innovation, a disruption in the technology but it was still just a product with no meaning or style behind it,
          those with it were most likely labeled a “nerd”. Fifteen years later Apple came along and made functionally
          the same product but they didn't sell a phone <strong>they sold the idea of challenging the status quo</strong>, the idea of
          thinking differently. They did this through beautifully designed, user-friendly products and this just happens
          to culminate in the iPhone. By selling this idea they changed the word achieving peak market saturation at
          over 6.1 million phones sold(Sinek, 2009). This shows that we don't want radical new products or forms of art
          but rather a slow dispersion of existing ideas in optimized versions that resonate with our values.

        </div>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Along the same lines, if individuals will spend money to hire a product to solve a problem then all the media
          has to do is <strong>convince us that we have a problem and show us a convenient solution.</strong> When these problems are
          created they can be referred to as <strong>endogenous preferences</strong> or preferences that are created by the economic
          system itself. Thus “It is circular to argue that markets perform a valuable function by satisfying
          preferences if the market itself creates them.”(Wright, 104). But the true “triumph of advertising in the
          culture industry is that consumers feel compelled to buy and use its products even though they see through
          them.”(Adorno, Bennett, 2022). We learn the practices of international mega-corporations yet we still support
          them. We understand the harm producing these wasteful products has on the environment yet we still continue to
          shop. We see the contradictions of capitalism yet we still consume. In this late capitalistic society,
          production is no longer the goal but rather consumption.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">Life Online</h2>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Even the simplest situations have become commodified including relaxing at home. We used to have the home as
          our first place, work as our second, and a third place to relax and socialize. However, these have all more or
          less been <strong>consumed by the digital abstract world</strong>. Many people work exclusively online or utilize digital
          products before coming how to consume digital media to relax, and are only a part of digital communities.
          According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Men spent 5.6 hours per day in leisure and sports
          activities, women 4.9 hours, in 2021” and of that time on average 3.7 hours(66-75%) was spent consuming
          media(BLS, 2022). This leaves <strong>less than 2 hours a day</strong> when people are being active, socializing, traveling, or
          just thinking.
        </p>
        <div class="container">
          <div class="row align-items-center gx-3 gy-5 mt-3 mb-5">

        </div>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          With such a large percentage of our free time spent relaxing in this way, many influencers have emerged and
          filled this opening in the market now being dubbed “sleepy girls” online.
          In a culture where mental health awareness is on the rise these creators' bold documentation of their
          lifestyle opened up an opportunity to profit off of their daily challenges and <strong>turned “sadness and struggle
          into a brand”</strong> gaining a sizable market share(Balao, 2023). Journalist Mayi Hughes explores these “mentally
          unwell, sad girl, sleepy girl archetype influencers” calling them out on building a following based on
          presenting themselves as “raw, unapologetically “authentic” selves” before launching their own brands and paid
          podcasts. They have reached a new level of the social interpretation of culture where depicting everyday life
          is considered culture. This capitalizes on the public's desire to consume content and fit in. However, the
          danger is in the fact that <strong>these individuals are not being raw and authentic</strong>, it is glamorized and edited
          which in turn leads to a boom in average individuals expressing their own personal brand through forced
          “candid” images and photo dumps where people feel the need to stage photo ops. Our digital presence has become
          an edited choreographed facade more about the idea of how you appear or are represented to others than how you
          actually are.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          These social networking sites are publicly available and contribute to how others perceive you. In our late
          capitalistic society, these networks become the main channel for <strong>sustaining relationships without physical
          interactions.</strong> However, as we previously established we spend so much time pursuing connections around the
          world and consuming what they produce that we begin to have less of a stake in each of these relationships.
          Consequently, the average number of close friends has decreased with only 13% of people having 10 or more in
          2021 compared to 33% in 1990. Additionally, in 1990 only 3% of responders indicated that they had no close
          friends which has since increased to 12%(Majidi, 2023). In contrast as of 2023, the average number of
          Instagram followers per user was over 150. All of these networking sites and still we are becoming more
          disconnected. Studies have identified networking to be the predominant reason for utilizing social
          media(Lefika and Tracy, 2020). We collect and cultivate connections but only reap a fraction of the benefits.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">The Personal is Political</h2>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Our desire to network and our preference to consume new media combine to create the rising habit of
          over-consuming digital media. This preference itself is not of your own choosing; it has been taken advantage
          of and marketed to the extreme allowing the line to become blurred between personal and professional in many
          jobs, particularly those in the digital realm. Some insist that you complete personal projects to gain work
          experience before entering the field. These projects are then compiled into another form of personal branding
          through the creation of a portfolio website showcasing your collection of creative work. Portfolios also
          reflect and reinforce the values of the capitalistic system, wherein one's worth is often measured by their
          ability to generate profitable products or services. By having targeted recommendations are sorted to the top
          it gives prospective employees an <strong>incentive to lie or stretch the truth</strong> to get where they want. This is known
          and openly recommended rather than just making the expectations more realistic. Thus, keeping constant control
          over your digital footprint gives you a more cohesive personal brand further enforcing the cycle.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Creating a strong personal brand starts with self-discovery.<strong> You have to know yourself before you can
          effectively project yourself to the world</strong>…and communicates your value to those you are seeking to do business
          with.”(Blacksmith, Poeppelman, 113-114). We have age restrictions on the use of alcohol, drugs, gambling, and
          other highly addictive coping mechanisms yet we willingly hand younger and younger children unfettered control
          over limitless media. Perpetuating this cycle will only further destabilize this unhealthy behavior. This
          internalization of personal branding is entwined with the mantra "the personal is political" where we can see
          the micro world of interactions and individual experiences being tied to the larger social structures and
          power dynamics at play. (Hanisch, 1969). This blurring is exacerbated by the solipsistic shift of personal
          issues as a problem for the whole world, using social media to share your emotions.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Conversely,<strong> the shifting of global or corporate problems onto the individual.</strong> For instance, in the problem of
          climate change, large industries contribute a significant percentage of the emissions worldwide(Statista,
          2024). Yet, their response often revolves around marketing products as more "sustainable" and encouraging
          climate-friendly alternatives rather than implementing those changes at their level. The top three reasons why
          European companies invest in sustainable marketing strategies were: For the brand image(20.76%), To increase
          sales(18.26%), and then because it's the right thing to do(13.93%)(Majidi, 2024). If we simplify the 9
          categories it becomes<strong> 82.16% to make more money and 22.18% for the environment itself</strong> demonstrating
          capitalism's preference to maximize profit above all else. Furthermore, they may simply be purchasing "Carbon
          offsets" that don't necessarily ensure carbon is removed let alone they then no longer have to have the moral
          weight of cultural destruction on their shoulders, yet they still gain the same sales benefits.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">Survalience Capitalism</h2>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Throughout history, <strong>information has always been a form of currency</strong> traded to gain insight into others around
          you but now more than ever it has become the new gold. This contemporary stage of capitalism hinges on data
          collection with corporations vying to gather large amounts of information allowing them to fuel targeted
          advertising and enabling more accurate algorithms. Shoshana Zuboff explored this idea dubbing it Survalience
          capitalism saying "It is no longer enough to automate information flows about us; the goal is to automate
          us."(Zuboff, 2018). Tech giants like Apple and Google exemplify these ideas as they continue to highlight the
          importance of privacy but only when it is closed-source and proprietary. They then expand their scope to
          extract more and more insights from your behavior. Zuboff goes on to point out that<strong>“The pattern of violations
          is a feature, not a bug”.</strong> 
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Surveillance capitalism does not just stem from corporations but rather from their symbiotic relationship with
          governments to aid each other in the pursuit of information gathering. Governments make claims of the data's
          use for national security but are willing to encroach upon privacy rights to do so. For example, the UK has
          attempted to ban end-to-end encryption(E2EE) as it hinders law enforcement efforts(Gov.uk, 2023). Or even the
          recent ban on TikTok for “data safety” when it is simply corruption. Despite these efforts, <strong>no coercion is
          required</strong> as we willingly submit to being tracked, recorded, and monitored in various ways. Whether we consent
          through lengthy end-user license agreements or simply by what we provide to others in our personal branding
          efforts and larger digital footprint,<strong> we are complicit in the proliferation of our own data.</strong> As Ian Bennett of
          Epoch philosophy aptly states, it becomes a "narcissistic and parasocial endeavor of bastardized image-based
          friendships and self-consumption." Thus, capitalism has become even more abstracted from its original
          intention with a prioritization for digital data over concrete goods and services.
