        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Throughout the process of creating "Selling the self" and delving into the world of personal branding and
          hyper-consumerism in late-stage capitalism I have had many “a-ha” moments. At a base level I have learned how
          to quickly develop a content forward web site with multiple pages. For this purpose I had to adapt to the
          challenges of the content and adjust the structure of the site to reflect the content it is displaying. This
          completely altered how I view the user journey as I was forced to consider the flow the user takes when
          consuming the content.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">On a more personal level, this topic has greatly affected my outlook on life as I learned about whole fields
          of study that explore each section of this topic and significant of affect they each have. For example, I have
          never been one who is concerned with data security or smart assistants monitoring my conversations. As scary
          as it sounded I didn't know what the data was used for or who had access to it. Now, however, I have journeyed
          down the rabbit hole and begun transitioning over to open-source, self-hosted software whenever it is
          possible. This has completely changed my outlook on how I interact with the world. I have not only become a
          conscious consumer, as I urge all of you to be, but I also stop and think before I produce any content. I want
          to be aware of every place that information can travel and control who has access to it. It is this same reach
          that mainly surprised me, there is no aspect of life that is safe from its grasp and nowhere to run.
          Furthermore, much of the content is buried under cultural stigma such as caring about data security is
          nerdy(and thus not mainstream) or understanding complex ideologies is too academic(no one takes the time to
          learn). While these have a sense of truth to them I believe both should be discussed more. Something as simple
          as where your information is in the cloud should be common knowledge. Similarly, we have blindly adopted these
          habits of overconsumption without asking why.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">While I believe this site does the content justice and provides a smooth flow from one topic to the next in
          the future I don't think the format will remain the same. I enjoy breaking down the content into sections as
          it becomes easier to parse, the original paper is 26 pages long, but the format of the project shaped the
          content more than the content was allowed to shape itself. Because of all of the restrictions, I believe a
          simple medium article can accomplish the same goal achieved here if not better as it would be concise and have
          the ability to reach a much larger audience. Likewise, I believe that making a hub of information to educate
          individuals on the same topic would be even more helpful. Allowing users to learn about the concepts with
          links to more in depth research along with actionable content for them to pursue accordingly.
