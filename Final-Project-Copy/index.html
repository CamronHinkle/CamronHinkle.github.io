          To illuminate the detrimental effects of late-stage capitalism, particularly its stifling of progress and
          commodification of the human existence. Capitalism perpetuates a cycle of deferred gratification, wherein
          individuals sacrifice present enjoyment for an elusive future that never materializes. Through examples like
          personal branding and social media, we uncover capitalism's mechanisms, encouraging readers to reclaim agency

              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p class="lead">
                  Ethan Letsch is a student at Loyola University now majoring in Accounting after switching from
                  marketing. He is originally from Minnesota where he started off working for a car dealership and now
                  works at a private investment firm. Going into college he wasn't sure what he wanted to do all he knew
                  was that it would involve business and this led him to believe that “No business can survive without
                  marketing.” Understanding what pulls people to and from certain businesses intrigued him. However,
                  during his Sophomore year, he found he was naturally good at accounting as it's all about logic and
                  systems. “You can do anything in business with an accounting degree. You don't have to be an
                  accountant, I don't wanna be an accountant” It was the overlap of these widely applicable fields but
                  in opposing ways that drew him in. A regular business cannot survive without either.

                </p>
                <p class="lead">He was very passionate insisting that “marketing yourself is the single greatest skill
                  you can have
                  especially at this point in our lives.” We may not have the history or a body of work to draw so all
                  you have to rely on is your drive. You need this skill to Promote yourself to a business, to other
                  people, to a roommate, or even to a potential partner. He went back to business saying “When selling a
                  product for a business you are not selling the product you're selling your own ability” and if you
                  can't form that connection it is impossible to make the sale. Personal branding is very similar
                  “You're saying this is why you should want me in your life”.
                  Ethan immediately admitted that he falls victim to brand names “I see that label and think that is
                  what I want because that is what I have been conditioned to want.” He described this phenomenon by
                  saying that society pressures you into believing “If you don't have X then you're not worth Y.” He
                  understood that this is a very dangerous trap to fall into but still we can't escape. He ultimately
                  tied it back to identifying the values of a brand image and wanting to be able to buy into these so
                  that they would superficially reflect on him.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">When commenting on social media he noted that he doesn't post much but he is constantly
                  scrolling
                  through his following and his Explore pages. “I was just thinking about this today how my explore page
                  is curated perfectly to draw me in” again and again and broke down the content to reflect what he
                  looks at most. Next Snapchat and TikTok but he is trying to ween himself off “95% of my time on the
                  train is spent on TikTok”. Ethan isn't pleased with this use of time and is trying to replace this by
                  reading The Millionaire Next Door a non-fiction book recommended by his grandfather whom he wants to
                  follow in his financially successful footsteps. He noted that he is on Facebook to keep up with his
                  parents but doesn't use it otherwise. Ending with his use of LinkedIn which has ramped up since he got
                  to college, claiming “I am still a novice with some features but I'm climbing towards that 500+
                  connections”.
                </p>
                <P class="lead">These connections are important to him as it is his major form of networking which for
                  him is
                  “Vitally important as a college degree is great but if you stay in your room you won't be able to do
                  anything with it.” He went on to talk about how the person who's hiring will give the job to their
                  best friend's son who just graduated over someone more qualified but without connections. He
                  reiterated that “The most important thing you can do in college is networking. All that counts is
                  knowing the right people and having an applicable degree”
                </P>
                <P class="lead">Furthermore, Ethan is very concerned about the future as “We live in a world that is
                  increasingly
                  saturated” and “The more the world is increasingly globalized by technology, by our attitudes towards
                  people that aren't our neighbors the more we need increasing amounts of information to consume to feel
                  satisfied. What was once enough to be happy is the baseline norm. Where a degree and networking skills
                  used to be extra now they are expected at the baseline, the new norm.” This constant consumption is
                  unsustainable as we are all becoming more dissatisfied with our living conditions compared to the
                  commercial realism we are bombarded with on screens. Employers say that no one cares about the work
                  they do anymore. No one wants to work anymore. Well, 30 years ago people thought that they needed to
                  put in their blood, sweat, and tears and in turn, they would succeed and be promoted until they could
                  afford a vacation home. “Now we can put in 70 hours a week and still be fighting tooth and nail to
                  stay above the poverty line. We don't care less about the work we put in we just know that the same
                  amount of work doesn't take us as far.” “That baseline has been raised so high that we feel
                  demoralized and honestly I think we should.”
                </P>
                <P class="lead">Ethan immediately noted that “My driving force is money. I know it shouldn't be but it
                  is” going on
                  to explain that any four-year degree used to be able to help you rise to the top of a company.
                  Indicating that now even with that degree you aren't rising up and the value of the money you are
                  making is decreasing. “I would love to say I'm going to college to fulfill my passion, but I'm not.
                  I'm someone who cares about learning and I do feel fulfilled that I'm creating a better worldview
                  through a college institution but I'm going to college to set myself up for my future.” Beyond that he
                  indicated having certain expectations out of life including wanting to get married and have children.
                  He said that “while this would be possible without a certain level of money it certainly wouldn't be
                  comfortable.” Therefore, although his career is not glamorous saying “No kid grows up and goes god I
                  want to be a financial advisor for the largest private insurance firm in the continental United
                  States. but still, I would love to work there.” This shows that his preference for a high quality of
                  life outweighs his preference for taking pleasure in his work.

                <p class="lead">
                  Gianna Dimperio is a student at Columbia College Chicago majoring in User Experience with a minor in
                  programming. She is currently working for a social media brand called Hardcore Italian. With a
                  background in visual design she quickly “found an innate love for why and how people use things” From
                  there she found Columbia and the Interactive Arts programs they had and knew that's where she had to
                  go “It's a done Deal.” She immediately made it very clear that a college degree is “very, very
                  important.” and talked about how without a degree, let alone experience, the chances of getting a
                  quality job are very low. Mentioning that even if you “just have some type of examples of your work or
                  case studies” this will be imperative to getting any job or “any type of coffee meeting with anybody”
                  already in the business. She went on to mention that potential employers are not going to know what
                  you're capable of without seeing any of the work you have already done. Furthermore, with the
                  initiative to complete personal projects that expand on what you're learning in class, you will stand
                  out from the pack.
                </p>
                <p  class="lead">In terms of personal branding her approach is very straightforward, put your best work into the
                  portfolio you share with others and when you land an interview do everything you can to be the best
                  fit. She calls this “the technique of talking myself up to a point where I say yes to everything”
                  noting that you can always learn a new skill or improve before starting the job if they continue with
                  you as a candidate. Beyond that it's all a grassroots expansion of connections and about helping those
                  who helped you. She does believe that portfolios are an accurate way for employers to get an idea of
                  who their candidates are and what they're capable of beyond a simple resume despite fudging the truth
                  on her own.“When you are talking to an employer that does not know who you are in any way of the word,
                  I think it's a good way for them to get a gist of who you are and what you do without really knowing
                  who you are.” She then goes back to talking herself up as a portfolio is just a tool to facilitate
                  conversation and initiate that connection without you being there to speak for yourself initially. You
                  need to really be able to sell yourself and the value you will provide for the company based on your
                  background as well as your goals for the future.
                </p>
                <p  class="lead">She primarily uses Instagram for everything, “even the professional environment. Like, my Explore
                  page is full of just coding how to do this, how to graphic design tricks on Illustrator, all that
                  stuff.” A simple social media site has transitioned to be a hub for interpersonal connection as well
                  as, professional tips, and more importantly advertising. Additionally, she uses TikTok and even went
                  so far as to say “I know it's a thing right now that people ask TikTok questions more than they ask
                  Google. … if I have a question, I might ask TikTok, because a quick video will come up of like, oh,
                  yeah, just click this, this, and this in Illustrator, and it's done.”. Despite this, she herself does
                  not post very often by her estimate she hasn't posted anything for the past two years.
                </p>
                <p  class="lead">Additionally, Gianna seemed to recognize the importance of networking but personally she likes to
                  meet people, more naturally, “I think networking is really important, but, like, when it's, like,
                  natural, I think that, like, going to networking events is a little, cliche and, like, too much, in my
                  opinion.” Instead, she uses platforms like LinkedIn to connect with those she meets in person and then
                  if connections are strong they will migrate off of There and onto another platform like text messages.
                  Indicating that as a creature of habit, she has “been following the same designers and brands for so
                  long, but it's, like, a notoriety thing where if I'm following somebody and they just started this
                  brand, I'm gonna be like, oh, I need to check it out because I know that they're great.” This connects
                  back to her networking approach as she simply sticks to what she knows and has tested and grown
                  laterally from there while still maintaining her current connections.
                </p>
                <p  class="lead">Despite all of this social networking when I brought up data collection there was a strong and
                  instantaneous “Don't like it at all.” and she insisted on trying to maintain her own privacy when
                  interacting on the web. Anytime they ask for her information she rejects everything but the bare
                  minimum. However, she noted that she is a novice in this field and doesn't have a full understanding
                  of what data is captured, what it is used for, or if this actually helps her in any way. But does not
                  care enough to change her habits or delve into how to prevent this.

                  Sandra Komarowski is a marketing strategist and professor at Columbia College Chicago, and currently a
                  PhD candidate at Charles University in Prague focusing on arts marketing and trying to merge
                  disciplines like art history, creative industries, startup area, business development, and marketing.

                <p class="lead">Sandra Komarowski is a marketing strategist and professor at Columbia College Chicago,
                  and currently
                  a PhD candidate at Charles University in Prague focusing on arts marketing and trying to merge
                  disciplines like art history, creative industries, startup area, business development, and marketing.
                  She began in market research and working with branding agencies for clients like Apple and Starbucks,
                  but her continuous search for knowledge led her back to education as a profession “I fell in love with
                  it and started teaching initially at Loyola”. Very quickly she found that you can't study marketing
                  without discussing its ancient origins. Therefore, entering arts marketing allowed her to merge
                  passions for art history and marketing, motivated by the unique marketing practices in ancient
                  societies and modern art practices. Not only is art history important but also the role of
                  “globalization, I mean, it's always been there.” and understanding business in different countries is
                  vital. She cites that “I always talk about it and I talk about it because I am a foreigner” but if it
                  wasn't for the internet then most individuals would forget or not care about markets outside their own
                  country. Sandra goes on to criticize the education system for not providing enough information about
                  international business or our places as global citizens. But through brands like McDonald's and
                  Starbucks expanding globally, they prove the profitability of a unified global market. However, she
                  points out that there are cultural differences, especially in countries like Japan and Korea, that
                  require a nuanced understanding for successful branding. Finally, she stresses the need for
                  globalization to be included in the education system, citing her 10-year-old son's studies as an
                  example of increasing global awareness.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">Mrs. Kumorowski then brought up a very interesting point that Individuals now act as
                  brands while
                  brands want to be perceived as individuals, and it's crucial “to have a global mindset since most of
                  the businesses or industries are global now”. But she then identifies that ensuring uniqueness in
                  personal branding is vital to avoid uniformity. Everyone should enhance their heritage and strengths
                  to promote their personal brand effectively, standing out from the majority. “It's easy to just follow
                  celebrity trends or to want to look like them but everyone must find their niche and use personal
                  strengths to promote their brand.” For her own brand Sandra primarily uses Instagram, Facebook, and
                  LinkedIn all of which she has been on since their inception. Instagram and Facebook are used for a mix
                  of personal and professional posts, connecting with family, friends, and students. While LinkedIn is
                  used strictly for professional purposes, avoiding private posts. Interestingly outside of consuming
                  the content of close relatives, she uses Instagram primarily for research purposes in her role as a
                  consumer behavior researcher. They follow accounts like 'people of Palm Beach' to study consumer
                  behavior within specific microcultures, such as Palm Beach's wealthier residents. As well as use
                  social media for experimentation in terms of research for specific client metrics. This differs
                  significantly from our other two interviewees as they primarily consume content without posting much
                  themselves.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">Then she agreed that we have a responsibility to reduce hyper-consumption even if it
                  decreases
                  economic productivity. Recognizing our overconsumption, especially of tangible products “ I mean,
                  there's no way around it because it's just at your fingertips”. Personally, she finds herself trending
                  towards valuing experiences over products. Ultimately she believes that the idea is to find a balance
                  in operations where a brand is profitable while reducing its footprint and achieving social,
                  financial, and environmental sustainability. Despite this view, she believes that brands like Stanley
                  “are doing something right”, as they are promoting sustainability by reducing plastic waste. Even
                  though some people collect these, which might seem contradictory, their overconsumption does not
                  outweigh the benefit for the environment over plastic bottles. Noting that high-quality, long-lasting
                  products are worth the investment over cheap, disposable items, contributing to a healthier planet.
                  But she does urge there to be research into “the percentage of consumers, of Stanley consumers are
                  collectors also. So if it's like 20%, then it's a big deal, right? If it's just one 2%, then it's not
                  going to make a huge impact in the marketplace.”
                </p>
                <p class="lead">The conversation shifted to capitalism as a whole where she discussed the broad and
                  evolving
                  definitions of capitalism, suggesting it's difficult to describe or change in simple terms. Just as
                  capitalism has evolved to the late stage we know she believes it is foolish to believe this is as far
                  as it will develop. She notes other previous systems and even ties back to the ancient Greek form of
                  democracy and how different it has become today. Then she mentions the possibility of improving
                  capitalism for everyone's benefit and speculates about a new hybrid system emerging from current
                  economic theories that may be able to benefit everyone with less harm. Sandra suggests that once again
                  achieving a balance is crucial, where brands can be profitable while also ensuring sustainability in
                  environmental, social, and financial terms. It's suggested that brands should strive to make everyone
                  better off using capitalism, hinting that while profit is necessary, the way it is achieved and its
                  impact matters significantly. She refers back to her common lectures on B-corporations and how
                  companies like Patagonia can help you create the ultimate scenario for your brand where you are
                  profitable enough, but at the same time, your carbon footprint and your operations are not disturbing
                  the world too much. This left me with the idea that our story is still unfolding. We need to stop
                  viewing our time as the end of an arc or story and instead, merely a middle chapter that sets the
                  stage for what is to come next.
