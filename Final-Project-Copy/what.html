          I am going to assume most people know what capitalism is but you may be wondering what I mean by <i>late-stage
          capitalism.</i> This phrase was first coined by <strong>Werner Sombart</strong> at the beginning of the 20th century to describe
          the different stages or forms that capitalism takes throughout its development, with late-stage capitalism
          being the last stage described. However, to be more specific <strong>I am referring to the current substage of
          late-stage capitalism that is concerned with its current productivity and lived contradictions. </strong> Through
          examining these contradictions we can hope to see its total nature and effects. Nietzsche wrote about how
          history has "overflown into the human condition" and now instead of engaging in life and producing new
          culture, we are merely spectators(Bennett, 2022). We retroactively examine the experiences of others rather
          than engaging in them ourselves. This enables us to be pacified while we learn but do not act, we consume but
          do not produce. On the other hand, Marx commonly wrote about how <strong>capitalism produces some of the strongest
          conditions for its own collapse including things like monopolies, the wealth divide, and worker
          dissatisfaction. </strong> Here we will explore these conditions and how our current system has managed to use its
          weaknesses as a feature to ensure its longevity.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          After the fall of the Berlin Wall as Marx had theorized mega corporations did emerge but rather than
         <strong>increasing the competition </strong> that would regulate the market they chose to<strong> cooperate and merge. </strong> This eliminated
          the potential for any competition as to why one company should lose when both can win, proving capitalism is a
          non-zero-sum game(Bennett, 2021). This leads to a global market or in other words capitalism became a mask for
          geopolitical imperialism. Naomi Klein further explains this contradiction as “Even though the promise of
          globalization is that it will lead to development in poor countries…what is actually happening is … <Strong>a race to
          the bottom. </Strong>” When the primary audience and the corporation prefer to be low-cost, then there are no limits on
          what the market will do to drive down that cost. In turn, development comes about only through exploitation,
          not education. This greatly benefited the rich continuing the cycle of growing wealthier and as a result
          obtaining more sway to shape laws and policies to keep them in power. The wealth divide thus continued to grow
          exponentially and as of “the third quarter of 2023, <strong>66.6 percent of the total wealth in the United States was
          owned by the top 10 percent of earners.</strong> ”(Statista, 2023).

        <p class="about-text px-5">
          As production was outsourced to workers with lower wages corporate America identified that it could
          effectively affix the meaning of success and happiness(essentialism) by solidifying <strong>the American dream.</strong>
          Material solutions were glorified as the solution for the existential issues that arise from a class-conscious
          worker. Giving them a goal to strive for their dissatisfaction with their life was channeled into their work
          ethic. Thus, <strong>keeping those feelings of resentment towards the self, not the system.</strong>  However, with this need to
          climb the social ladder, it became hard to separate the pursuit of happiness from the pursuit of wealth. We
          can see this as Jonathon Wright put it “Western society is built on a market ethic of <strong>maximizing consumption</strong>,
          while Buddhist society in South Asia focuses on <strong>minimizing desire</strong>”(105). Therefore, no matter how many
          preferences you satisfy you may still not achieve that happiness but “one can feel content if poor, if one has
          few desires”(105).
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Nevertheless, no matter what your needs or preferences are you need capital to fulfill them but as Frederick
          Jameson and Slavoj Zizek say <strong>“It is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of
          capitalism.”</strong>(Bennett, 2021). Every subsequent cultural object will make use of capitalistic pathways and be
          consumed in the marketplace. We have no escape from capitalism and thus there is no way to envision its
          downfall. How do you rebel against a normalized postmodern rebellion? Any viable alternative will be absorbed
          by the system as a victorious rebellion only makes a better tyrant.
