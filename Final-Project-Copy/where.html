          I am going to assume most people know what capitalism is but you may be wondering what I mean by late-stage
          capitalism. This phrase was first coined by Werner Sombart at the beginning of the 20th century to describe
          the different stages or forms that capitalism takes throughout its development, with late-stage capitalism
          being the last. However, to be more specific the late-stage capitalism I am concerned with is explored through
          its current productivity and lived contradictions. Through examining these contradictions we can hope to see
          its total nature and effects. Marx commonly wrote about how capitalism produces some of the strongest
          conditions for its own collapse including things like monopolies, the wealth divide, and worker
          dissatisfaction. On the other hand, Nietzsche wrote about how history has “overflown into the human condition”
          and now instead of engaging in life and producing new culture, we are merely spectators(Bennett, 2022). We
          retroactively examine the experiences of others rather than engaging in them ourselves. This enables us to be
          pacified while we learn but do not act, we consume but do not produce.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Writer, philosopher, and critic Mark Fisher theorized about the implications of late capitalism in the 21st
          century and succinctly described it as “Were trapped in the 20th century. What does the 21st century mean? It
          is to have the 20th century culture on higher definition screens”. The same issues still exist as their
          solutions are just abstractions of the issue. Through this light, it becomes apparent that our current state
          of late capitalism is unique due largely to globalization. As the Berlin Wall came crashing down capitalism
          and communism came face to face and when the rubble cleared we could see that capitalism blanketed the globe.
          Just as Marx had theorized mega corporations did emerge but rather than increasing the competition that would
          regulate the market they chose to cooperate and merge. This eliminated the potential for any competition as to
          why one company should lose when both can win, proving capitalism is a non-zero-sum game(Bennett, 2021).
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          We can see that capitalism's contradictions go hand in hand with a global market. When we shift our lens on
          capitalism we begin to see how it is a mask for a new geopolitical imperialism. In “Globalization and Culture”
          John Tomlinson discusses how capitalism claims to be the best system due to our competitive human nature and
          by spreading capitalism all nations will prosper under one unified market(10-12). Under these pretenses, we
          fought wars for capitalism to prevail against communism. Capitalism then used these very wars and the
          accompanying red scare to advance its hold. However, eradicating its potential opponents was not enough as it
          still used their corpses to scare us into order and assimilate developing populations. Under imperialism,
          these military conquests may have resulted in land and resources or power and control but now we seek to
          exploit their labor in the name of progress without improving their rights(Klein, 2003). The more capitalism
          encompasses the world's population the more preferences there are to create and subsequently satisfy. Except
          the problem arises that without the rights and wages of a developed late capitalist country those who produce
          the products can no longer afford them. Naomi Klein further explains this contradiction as “Even though the
          promise of globalization is that it will lead to development in poor countries and that wages will go up and
          the situation will improve what actually happening is … a race to the bottom.” When the primary audience and
          the corporation prefer to be low-cost, then there are no limits on what the market will do to drive down that
          cost. They outsource production and eventually, the workforce does understand the nature of this oppression
          and begins to push back. In turn, development comes about only through exploitation, not education. This
          greatly benefited the rich continuing the cycle of growing wealthier and as a result obtaining more sway to
          shape laws and policies to keep them in power.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          The wealth divide thus continued to grow exponentially and as of “the third quarter
          of 2023, 66.6 percent of the total wealth in the United States was owned by the top 10 percent of
          earners.”(Statista, 2023). Where the industrialized workforce used to look for common manual labor the
          classic, respectable manufacturing jobs nearly die out in favor of “McJobs” in the service sector. These now
          make up nearly ⅔ of the workforce with most of the remaining being made up of research and development for
          services or cleaning up within that space(Theory Toolbox Chapter 8: Space/Time p. 130). The workforce became
          dissatisfied with this system not fulfilling its promises to improve their financial situation. They soon
          became class-conscious longing for upward mobility.

          However, corporate America identified that it could effectively affix the meaning of success and
          happiness(essentialism) by solidifying the American dream. We can see this process through media like the 2007
          TV series Mad Men. The show focuses on how the wealthy professionals modeled the ideal life, consisting of
          material goods like a white picket fence, a nice car, a perfect house, and 2.5 children to target the unhappy.
          Material solutions were glorified as the solution for the existential issues that arise from a class-conscious
          worker. Giving them a goal to strive for their dissatisfaction with their life was channeled into their work
          ethic. As a result, it became common to think that “If you fail in the American Dream it is because you didn't
          work hard enough.” thus keeping those feelings of resentment towards the self, not the system. However, with
          this need to climb the social ladder, it became hard to separate the pursuit of happiness from the pursuit of
          wealth. And while many claim that money can't buy you happiness it can help satisfy your preference. When
          these two become synonymous then an efficient system would produce more preferences or as Jonathan Wright put
          it in his book Ethics in Economics “Western society is built on a market ethic of maximizing consumption,
          while Buddhist society in south Asia focuses on minimizing desire”(105). In this system, the West is about
          getting yourself ahead and the East is finding your place within your community. Therefore, no matter how many
          preferences you satisfy you may still not achieve that happiness but “one can feel content if poor, if one has
          few desires”(105).
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Nevertheless, no matter what your needs or preferences are you need capital to fulfill them but as Frederick
          Jameson and Slavoj Zizek say “It is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of
          capitalism.”(Bennett, 2021). Nothing new can arise to challenge this system as its ideologies have been
          naturalized permeating the culture. Every subsequent cultural object will make use of capitalistic pathways
          and be consumed in the marketplace. We have no escape from capitalism and thus there is no way to envision its
          downfall. Even methods of rebellion are commodified paths within the system as any preference presents a
          market opportunity.
