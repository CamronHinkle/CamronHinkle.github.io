        <p class="about-text px-5">
          This major turning ushered in new methods of<strong> enforcing power</strong>, leaving behind the panoptic institutions that
          controlled large populations of the past in favor of a new synoptic model where <strong>the many watch the
          few</strong>(Nealson, 2012 p. 130). The data from the behavioral surplus enables the automation of population-wide
          monitoring by just a handful of programs. In these systems, the threat of rebellion is reduced as the watchers
          willingly impose the rules on themselves and those around them. This is once again extended further by
          controlling the preferences of individuals through controlling what builds their (endogenous)preferences, the
          media, and advertising.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          This immense power is wielded almost exclusively by unregulated international media conglomerates that have
          slowly implemented vertical integration to corner the market on our perception. Through their control of the
          media, they are able to reproduce a skewed and censored worldview with limited interpretations and inaccurate
          representations. This perpetuates <strong>harmful biases</strong> as viewers internalize the portals they see as “A key problem
          with racism is that it can be a self-fulfilling phenomenon if people believe that Joseph will be a less
          productive worker because of his race there will be a discrimination in hiring him facing lower demand for his
          services. It is then rational for Joseph to underinvest in his own education because the expected returns will
          be lower. “(Wright, 141-142). This underscores how we situate ourselves within the context of our environment
          and if that context continuously tells us what we are like or should be like then we will believe it and
          replicate it.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Given that we established the sheer amount of time individuals spend consuming media it is important to
          consider the messages these stories/images tell us about the world. We can see an example of this through how
          <strong>Disney standardized play with their toys.</strong> The nature of play no longer evolves or changes beyond the plot
          explored on screen. However, their influence does not end with play but goes on to standardize how we consume
          media, form relationships, and work. We replicate the lives and relationships we consume even including the
          corporate brand personalities. Sociologist Erving Goffman described how we view these idealized fictitious
          worlds as “commercial realism" and these near-perfect worlds could come to fruition through our actions and
          purchases(746). For instance, many adults consume dating shows, reality TV, or other dramatized narratives
          where <strong>on-screen relationships are depicted as a necessity</strong>, not an option. This is reflected in modern dating
          culture through the stigmatization of being single. Individuals would rather settle for the most reasonable of
          limited imperfect options rather than embracing solitude or waiting for a genuine connection to naturally
          form.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">What is Our Role</h2>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Societal pressures drive us to conform yet paradoxically <strong>we all strive to stand out</strong> and thus converge to form
          the aesthetic of individuality. As Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno eloquently state in Dialectic of
          Enlightenment “Capitalism promises a system of raw individuality and transcendence of self-being able to act
          as a free agent in your pursuit of happiness” however, in practice, this promise is not achieved. Not only do
          we share the desire to construct a distinct image of ourselves but we are united in our <strong>forced uniformity.</strong> By
          largely consuming the same products due to limited viable options, many similar preferences emerge in the
          population. This can be seen when choosing products, defining yourself, or making career decisions leaving
          many working the same comfortable jobs and spending all they earn on simple needs. You are promised freedom
          but have restrictions and challenges imposed to minimize the number of those who deviate. In our
          late-capitalistic system, this false autonomy can be seen in modern advances like streaming services. They
          grant you the freedom of choice at the cost of increased individual fees. You pay the price to watch what you
          want when you want it but end up needing to subscribe to numerous services costing you more. In a way, <strong>they
          are to media as cars are to transportation.</strong> Both make you pay many individual fees to increase your autonomy
          across a preset network of options.
        </p>
      
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Transitioning back to our role in producing the content we consume, we have become caught in a cycle where<strong> we
          serve as both the product and the consumer.</strong> The media capitalizes on our digital participation to increase the
          production of content for free while simultaneously increasing the number of users for advertising. This
          vicious cycle of creating and consuming leaves no time to question and reflect on the world around us.
          Consequently, these large corporations function merely as husks exposing their empty values and promises
          without responsibility.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          This shows how <strong>we are trained to practice change rather than putting it into effect.</strong> This has permeated every
          aspect of our lives even the holidays we celebrate have been commercialized. They have been abstracted into
          visual identities of which we then go through the motions without a care for their significance. Christmas for
          example has largely shifted to focus on the presents, a tribute to consumerism. While Thanksgiving has
          followed suit revolving around the extravagant feast as an excuse for overconsumption and wastefulness. This
          allows conglomerates to take part in this phenomenon by establishing their own holidays such as Prime Day.
          Both children and professionals alike learn these systems, witness their success, and aspire to replicate it
          themselves. In our late-capitalistic system, becoming an idealized personal brand has almost become<strong> the new
          American dream.</strong> Ultimately, we are once again left with the illusion of choice where contextual factors
          largely determine the decisions we make and the outcomes we reach.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">What Does This Mean</h2>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          The deterministic nature of these choices as they're influenced by cultural and environmental factors
          contributes to what can be described as <strong>cultural entropy,</strong> where we all trend toward a “unity” or a global
          market(Tomlinson, 11). Upon zooming out further from our individual experiences, we can see the emerging
          <strong>patterns of repeating history </strong>echoed through the media of late capitalism with recycled ideas, artificially
          generated content, and self-aware films. Hence, we are prompted to assess the role of contextual factors on
          the path we choose for ourselves and <strong>the future we create for others.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          This culminates in transforming our capitalistic system into a <strong>decentralized self-replicating system</strong> that
          strengthens its grip with each generation. Mark Fisher aptly put it as we have engaged in "the slow
          cancelation of the future", where capitalism aims to prevent its fall by <strong>halting progress in favor of profit.</strong>
          This leaves our constant yearning for the utopias of tomorrow, and the resulting altruism toward our future
          selves as pointless since the perfect time will never arrive and we will lie in wait forgoing our potential
          enjoyment of the present. The hope for an eventual savior merely feeds the system and keeps the masses docile.
          This explains how we willingly sacrifice the concrete natural world for the abstract possibilities of the
          world of capital(Bennett, 2022). We saw the epitome of this phenomenon in the commodification of personal
          branding and the pursuit of financial freedom, as art was reduced to a representation of the work that we
          would produce. On social media, it matters less if you actually live a certain way as long as you make it
          appear that you do. However, all the while we are haunted by <strong>the promised futures that never arrive,</strong> and our
          goals never come to fruition as we forever yearn to escape the hardships of living for a paycheck. Ultimately
          this theory serves to help us understand the contradictions and implications of ourselves within capitalism
          and attempts to assist in opening our eyes to how capitalism operates, who it benefits, and in what ways it
          works through our actions. Even if we cannot fully escape <strong>awareness is the first step</strong> towards reclaiming our
          agency and taking part in shaping our collective future.
