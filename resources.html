        <p class="about-text px-5">
          With no end to capitalism it can be said that we are experiencing a “slow cancelation of the future”(Bennett,
          2022) our future is simply a reinterpretation of the past which changes how we experience time itself. We
          segment history into distinct epochs by the forms of art and artistic expression associated with them. Each of
          these is what Raymond Williams refers to in The Analysis of Culture as “the culture of selected tradition”
          that consists of the selected elements of a period that are still being studied and expressed forming a
          dynamic visual identity or as Gen Z would call it an aesthetic(53-55). Youth cultures of today merely merge
          these aesthetics to create new combinations that more closely match their visual image without yielding
          anything profoundly new. This image begins to form the base of our personal brand as an outward projection of
          the self.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Out of this practice, Lifestyle Branding emerged, and the market reflected this practice in a realization that
          “If companies wanted to be truly successful and competitive in the global marketplace they had to understand
          that their true product was not their product… it was an idea, a lifestyle, meaning itself” (Klein, 2003).
          Through this process brands form a symbiotic relationship where they become synonymous with the lifestyle of
          their target demographic. When each of these market segments identifies with a style they like this path
          guides them straight to the connected brand. The connection only grows stronger as the youth's style and
          identity become a reflection of the brand's ideologies further solidifying their cultural relevance. It didn't
          matter what the brand did, but rather why they did it. It matters what a consumer is thinking or experiencing
          while using a product and even more so how others will perceive them in relation to the products they have.
          IBM made the first touchscreen phone in 1992 it had a calculator, email, and could even access the web but
          only 50,000 people bought one(IBM). This was an innovation, a disruption in the technology but it was still
          just a product with no meaning or style behind it, those with it were most likely labeled a “nerd”. Fifteen
          years later Apple came along and made functionally the same product but they didn't sell a phone they sold the
          idea of challenging the status quo, the idea of thinking differently. They did this through beautifully
          designed, user-friendly products and this just happens to culminate in the iPhone. By selling this idea they
          changed the word achieving peak market saturation at over 6.1 million phones sold(Sinek, 2009). This shows
          that we don't want radical new products or forms of art but rather a slow dispersion of existing ideas in
          optimized versions that resonate with our values.

        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          When we are in any situation there are always motivations to do something to achieve our desired outcome. If
          we're in a time crunch then we have a motivation to grab a quick bite to eat to satisfy that hunger. Clayton
          Christensen dubbed this the jobs-to-be-done method: when you need a task or job done, you essentially hire a
          product to do that job. He said, “If a [businessperson] can understand the job, design a product and
          associated experiences…then when customers find themselves needing to get that job done they will hire that
          product”(The Fullstory Team, 2020). In lamens terms to get more people to consume your product you need to
          understand the why behind the what. His favorite example was that people on their morning commute hire a
          milkshake to fill them up and keep them entertained while driving. This user-centered approach further shifted
          lifestyle branding as marketing didn't need to improve the product they just had to target the specific
          scenarios their customers needed a job to be solved. Gone were the days of buying luxury products for their
          quality alone if you only wanted to hire expensive clothes to buy into their brand image. It doesn't matter
          what the product is just that it improves your personal brand image. For most corporations, the only job to be
          done is to make more money. So if a simple t-shirt with their logo will satisfy the customer's desires and
          save them money it is a mutually beneficial trade. Furthermore, this makes it much easier to rehire an old
          product than to invest in making a new one that might do the job. If a movie studio made a cult classic why
          invest to search for the next classic if they can invest the same amount to repackage the original movie?
          Disney remade their classic Cinderella movie in 2015 costing $95 million but grossing over $542.4 million
          worldwide, a classic story with dozens of movie adaptations and hundreds of variations yet it is still widely
          loved so why not satisfy this preference?

        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Along the same lines, if individuals will spend money to hire a product to solve a problem then all the media
          has to do is convince us that we have a problem and show us a convenient solution. When these problems are
          created they can be referred to as endogenous preferences or preferences that are created by the economic
          system itself(Wright, 104). The question then becomes how many of your preferences are truly your own? Even
          preferences for your favorite foods cannot be wholly attributed to you as we have specific palettes that
          corporations can target. Between your biological programmed reward pathways and the media, nearly all
          preferences from politics to pop culture can be explained. Thus “It is circular to argue that markets perform
          a valuable function by satisfying preferences if the market itself creates them.”(Wright, 104) our preferences
          are polluted by the market. But the true “triumph of advertising in the culture industry is that consumers
          feel compelled to buy and use its products even though they see through them.”(Adorno, Bennett, 2022). We
          learn the practices of international mega-corporations yet we still support them. We understand the harm
          producing these wasteful products has on the environment yet still we continue to shop. We see the
          contradictions of capitalism yet still we consume. In this late capitalistic society, production is no longer
          the goal but rather consumption.

        <p class="about-text px-5">
          Even the simplest situations have become commodified including relaxing at home. Relaxing in your private
          space was once an escape from the hustle and bustle of the outside world but it has become just another
          environment to consume products and media. Now when many people think about relaxing they want to put on their
          comfy clothes, which are branded from Lululemon to Nike, and then destress by scrolling social media or
          binge-watching shows. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Men spent 5.6 hours per day in
          leisure and sports activities, women 4.9 hours, in 2021” and of that time on average 3.7 hours(66-75%) was
          spent consuming media(BLS, 2022). This leaves less than 2 hours a day when people are being active,
          socializing, traveling, or just thinking.

        </p>
        <p class="about-text px-5">
          With such a large percentage of our free time spent relaxing in this way, many influencers have emerged and
          filled this opening in the market now being dubbed “sleepy girls” online. Through Raymond Williams's social
          definition of culture, found in “The Analysis of Culture”, we can see how these influencers are able to depict
          “a particular way of life” or “ordinary behaviors” in a new way(48). In a culture where mental health
          awareness is on the rise these creators' bold documentation of their lifestyle opened up an opportunity to
          profit off of their daily challenges and turned “sadness and struggle into a brand” gaining a sizable market
          share(Balao, 2023). Journalist Mayi Hughes, a Harvard Graduate with a background in sociology and politics,
          took to TikTok in an attempt to raise awareness of these branded personalities. She explores these “mentally
          unwell, sad girl, sleepy girl archetype influencers” calling them out on building a following based on
          presenting themselves as “raw, unapologetically “authentic” selves” before launching their own brands and paid
          podcasts. Some of the most popular of these lazy influencers include Emma Chamberlin and Madeline Argy with
          millions of followers each. They put in countless hours of work to appear effortless showcasing the reality of
          their life. These vloggers led to a boom in average individuals expressing their own personal brand through
          forced “candid” images and photo dumps where people feel the need to stage photo ops.
